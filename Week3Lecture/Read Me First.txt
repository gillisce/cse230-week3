This week we will be looking at the CheckedListBox and some of the built in functions
       
	   
	-Start with the Control List Box Project First
		- We will look a the following built in properties of the checkedListBox control
			○ setItemChecked
			○ Add Range
			○ Insert
			○ Clear
			○ IndexOf
			○ Sorted
		- Instead of the normal lecutre notes we will just be looking at the code
		- Feel free to rebuild this for your own practice or play with the code I wrote to explore
	-When you feel good about that move onto the next project
	

	- List Control with Data
		- This project will take a look at importing a data set 
		- Show how to output a real dataset into a list control

		- To Add a Database project (you can find file on BlackBoard)
			- Right click on project and choose add-existing items
		- On the Choose objects, select Prdouct name, product id, unit price
		- Use the NotesForAddingDataSource for steps on the rest of the process

	- TreeView Control
		- See notes within the code of the form and on the form for this control
		- This control allows a simple way to organize a list of values in a Hierarchy,
			we are able to add parent and child nodes and remove them from the item list










- Please provide any feedback on if this was a good way to get the material or not
- I am trying to switch it up so it wont always be just a PDF you have to read through
